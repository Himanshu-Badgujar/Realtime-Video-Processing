# Realtime Video Processing

## Description

This project was created as part of my 'Efficient Video Encoding' subject. This project is a demonstration of efficient video encoding using Python and the OpenCV library. It captures video from a webcam, applies grayscale and Gaussian blur processing to each frame, and then saves the processed frames as an output video file in the MP4 format.
